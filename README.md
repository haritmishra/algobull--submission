#The ScriptData class uses the requests library to fetch intraday data for the given stock symbol (script) using the Alpha Vantage API. The fetch_intraday_data method stores the fetched data as a dictionary with the stock symbol as the key. The convert_intraday_data method converts the fetched data into a pandas DataFrame with the specified columns. The class also implements methods for overloading the getitem, setitem, and contains operations to allow accessing, setting, and checking the existence of the intraday data for a given stock symbol.
#The indicator1 function takes a pandas DataFrame df and an integer timeperiod as inputs. It calculates the moving average of the close column in df by using the rolling method of pandas DataFrames. The window argument of the rolling method specifies the number of elements to be taken for the moving average, which is defined by the timeperiod input. The resulting moving average is stored in a new column indicator in the output DataFrame. The index of the input DataFrame df is also added as a new column timestamp in the output DataFrame.
#The Strategy class has a constructor __init__ that takes a script name as input. In the constructor, it initializes an instance of the ScriptData class and calls the fetch_intraday_data method to fetch the intraday data for the given script. Then it calls the indicator1 function to calculate the moving average of the close prices of the stock. Finally, it calls the generate_signals method to generate a DataFrame signals that contains the buy/sell/no_signal signals.

#The generate_signals method iterates through the close prices and the moving average of the close prices, and checks if the current moving average is greater than the current close price and the previous moving average was less than or equal to the previous close price. If this condition is true, it appends "BUY" to the signals list. Similarly, it checks if the current moving average is less than the current close price and the previous moving average was greater than or equal to the previous close price. If this condition is true, it appends "SELL" to the signals list. If neither of these conditions is true, it appends "NO_SIGNAL" to the signals list. Finally, it converts the signals list to a pandas DataFrame with timestamp and signal columns and returns it.
#You can then call these functions in the Strategy class to plot the candlestick chart and indicator chart for the given script.
